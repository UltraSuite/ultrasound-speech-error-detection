# Automatic detection of speech articulation errors using ultrasound tongue imaging

This directory contains a demo for audio feature extraction. It uses Kaldi tools to compute MFFCs, apply Mean Cepstral Variance Normalization, and add Delta features.

See `make_mfccs.sh` for an example. You will need to have Kaldi installed on your system.
